# Time Series Analysis on Store Item Demand Forecasting

### **Objective:** 
#### Predict 3 months of item sales at different stores
                                               

The dataset is provided with 4 columns:       
**date:** The date of sale    
**store:** This is the store number     
**item:** This is the item number       
**sales:** Sales made on that particular day  

### Process:
- Visualise the Time series
- Decomposing into trend, seasonal, cyclical and noise components
- Analyze the seasonality of a Time Series: additive and multiplicative.
- Check stationarity of data
- Statinarize Time series
- Plot ACF/PACF charts and find optimal parameters
- Build Time series models according to data
- Make predictions

### Results:
