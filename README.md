# Time Series Analysis on Store Item Demand Forecasting

### **Objective:** Predict 3 months of item sales at different stores
                                               

The dataset is provided with 4 columns:       
**date:** The date of sale    
**store:** This is the store number     
**item:** This is the item number       
**sales:** Sales made on that particular day  

### Approach:
- Visualise the Time series
- **Decomposing** into trend, seasonal, cyclical and noise components
- Analyze the **seasonality** of a Time Series: additive and multiplicative.
- Check **stationarity** of data - **Rolling Mean, ADCF Test(Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test)**
- Stationarize Time series - first **differencing**
- Plot **ACF/PACF** charts and find optimal parameters
- Build Time series models according to data - **AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA**
- Plot Residual distribution
- Make predictions
- **MAPE,SMAPE** as evaluation metric
